# Security Checklist for Adhyayan AI

## ‚úÖ Environment Variables Secured

### Client (.env.local)
- [x] NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY - Test account private key for sponsored payments
- [x] ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY - Admin private key for contract initialization
- [x] MONGODB_URI - Database connection string
- [x] GROQ_API_KEY - AI service API key
- [x] Firebase configuration keys - Authentication services
- [x] Civic client IDs - Wallet authentication

### Server (.env)
- [x] JWT_SECRET - Token signing secret
- [x] MONGODB_URI - Database connection
- [x] Multiple GROQ_API_KEY variants - AI services
- [x] ELEVENLABS_API_KEY - Text-to-speech service
- [x] GEMINI_API_KEY - Google AI service
- [x] Firebase admin configuration

## ‚úÖ Code Hardcoding Removed

### Contract Addresses
- [x] aptos-civic-integration.ts - Uses env var with fallback
- [x] test-contract.ts - Uses env var with fallback
- [x] getContractAddress() function - Uses env var with fallback

### API Keys & Secrets
- [x] No hardcoded MongoDB URIs in source code
- [x] No hardcoded private keys in source code
- [x] No hardcoded API keys in source code
- [x] All sensitive data references environment variables

## ‚úÖ Git Security

### .gitignore Configuration
- [x] .env and .env.local files ignored
- [x] Firebase admin SDK JSON files ignored
- [x] Private key files (*.key, *.pem) ignored
- [x] Node modules and build artifacts ignored
- [x] IDE and OS specific files ignored

### Repository Preparation
- [x] Sensitive files not tracked by git
- [x] .env.example provided for setup guidance
- [x] README.md documents environment setup
- [x] All hardcoded secrets removed from tracked files

## ‚úÖ Production Readiness

### Environment Configuration
- [x] All environment variables documented
- [x] Development vs production configs separated
- [x] Fallback values for development only (contract addresses)
- [x] Error handling for missing environment variables

### Blockchain Security
- [x] Real private keys secured in environment variables
- [x] Test account fallback mechanism implemented
- [x] Auto-funding system secured (devnet only)
- [x] Contract addresses configurable via environment

### Database Security
- [x] MongoDB connection secured with authentication
- [x] Connection string stored in environment variables
- [x] No database credentials in source code
- [x] Proper error handling for database failures

## ‚úÖ Deployment Configuration

### Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
- [x] Environment variables must be set in platform dashboard
- [x] Build process configured for Next.js
- [x] API URLs updated for production endpoints
- [x] Civic redirect URLs configured for production domain

### Backend (Railway/Heroku)
- [x] All server environment variables documented
- [x] Port configuration for platform requirements
- [x] Database connection for production MongoDB
- [x] CORS configuration for production frontend domain

### Smart Contract (Mainnet)
- [x] Contract deployment process documented
- [x] Mainnet vs devnet configuration separated
- [x] Account funding requirements documented
- [x] Plan initialization scripts prepared

## üîç Final Security Verification

### Before GitHub Push
- [ ] Run `git status` to check no sensitive files are staged
- [ ] Verify .env.local contains all required variables
- [ ] Test that application works with environment variables only
- [ ] Confirm no console.log statements expose sensitive data
- [ ] Check that error messages don't leak sensitive information

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Generate new private keys for production
- [ ] Update contract addresses for mainnet
- [ ] Configure production MongoDB cluster
- [ ] Set up production Firebase project
- [ ] Test payment flow on mainnet with small amounts
- [ ] Verify Civic authentication works with production domain

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Never Commit These Files
- `.env`
- `.env.local` 
- `*firebase-adminsdk*.json`
- `*.key`
- `*.pem`

### Always Use Environment Variables For
- Private keys (blockchain accounts)
- API keys (Groq, ElevenLabs, Firebase, etc.)
- Database connection strings
- JWT secrets
- OAuth client secrets

### Development vs Production
- Use different MongoDB databases
- Use different Firebase projects
- Use different Civic client IDs
- Use different contract addresses (devnet vs mainnet)
- Use different private keys

**üîí Security is critical for blockchain applications handling real payments. Always double-check environment variable configuration before deployment.**
